### Hosting Environment

ZKWeb support running on Asp.Net, Asp.Net Core and Owin.<br/>
All version compatible with same plugins.<br/>
Plugins should use the abstraction layer ZKWeb provided, and shouldn't dependent on Asp.Net (Core).<br/>

### .Net Core Support

ZKWeb provided basic support for .net core now.<br/>
But because NHibernate and Substitite are not support .net core yet,<br/>
functions like database access are unavailable.<br/>
